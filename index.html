          <h4>Parameters</h4>
          <p>The optimization works a little like if a human did it, the big difference being the number of parameters used and that myCoreAI sends optimized signals to the steering system every 15 mins, a human would generally do it far less often than that.</p>

          <ul class="bullet-list">

            <li>Lower peak demand and energy volatility</li>
            <li>Extended equipment life and reduced maintenance spend</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because the subscription fee is lower than verified energy savings, operating costs fall, NOI increases immediately, and cash flow improves without capital investment.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Client’s perspective:</strong> “Having explored most of the conventional carbon reduction techniques across the portfolio, we knew the next initiative was going to need to be something quite special to make an impact! EcoAI answered that call and enabled us to leverage our existing BMS to deliver quite staggering results. Our primary objective was to lower our carbon footprint in line with our Environmental Charter and by exploiting the properties characteristics through thermal inertia we achieved not only this but a number of other in-direct objectives. The in-built analytics has significantly influenced our life cycle management practices, energy profiles and surfaced opportunities that have yielded quantifiable cost avoidance adjustments. In essence, this application represented a paradigm shift; away from the typical reactive programmes to a proactive, forward thinking solution!”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“The results in year 1 were great, the fact that the system has managed to automatically improve on those savings in year two, as it now fully understands the needs of our building, is even better!”</p>
          <footer>Senior Facilities Manager</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“With sustainability being at the heart of our corporate culture and identity, energy conservation is central in our operation and processes. In EcoAI, we have identified a solution that enhances the intelligence and expands the capabilities of our Building Management System. The solution has also enabled us to make the roadmap clearer as we reflect on current practices and look to exercise the principles of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES). In-line with our pursuit for continuous improvement, the evaluation of our international portfolio is now underway, as this solution becomes part of our global strategy.”</p>
          <footer>Director of Facilities UK &amp; Ireland</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Though as an M&amp;E contractor, we don’t directly benefit from the automatic energy savings that EcoAI delivers, I’ve found the main benefit from an M&amp;E contractor’s perspective is utilising the system insights to investigate and target anomalous HVAC behaviours. I’ve worked closely with the EcoAI team to remotely identify areas of enhancement in the facility. This has enabled us to focus the attention of contractors to specific tasks therefore avoiding unnecessary costs to our client associated with making physical investigations. The analytics produced is based on systems that are fully optimised in real-time and so has been especially helpful in this regard.”</p>

          <h2>Why MyCoreAI BMS Optimisation Works</h2>

          <p>
            MyCoreAI works because it improves the gaps left by traditional Building Management System (BMS) control.
            Most BMS strategies rely on fixed schedules and static tuning, which struggle to adapt to real-world changes
            like weather, occupancy patterns, and seasonal drift.
          </p>

          <h3>Continuous optimisation on top of your existing BMS</h3>
          <p>
            MyCoreAI sits alongside the existing BMS and continuously identifies the lowest-energy way to maintain comfort
            and indoor air quality. By analysing live building data and outcomes, it makes small, safe adjustments at regular
            intervals to keep performance optimised over time.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Adapts to real building behaviour, not assumptions</li>
            <li>Reduces wasted energy from overheating, over-ventilation, and simultaneous heating/cooling</li>
            <li>Maintains comfort and compliance using defined constraints</li>
            <li>Prevents performance drift by optimising continuously, not occasionally</li>
            <li>Provides clear, auditable evidence of savings and performance</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The result is sustained energy reduction while protecting (and often improving) comfort—without replacing systems
            or disrupting building users.
